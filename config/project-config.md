## Key Decisions Made

1. **Project Structure**: Documentation-first approach with clear separation of concerns
2. **Decision Logging**: Structured markdown format with sequential numbering
3. **Development Process**: Iterative approach with high test coverage requirement
4. **Scope**: Backend-only solution with OpenAPI interface

## Technology Research Areas

- [ ] Strava API capabilities and limitations
- [ ] Webhook implementation options
- [ ] GPS coordinate processing and storage
- [ ] Route comparison algorithms
- [ ] Database technology selection
- [ ] API framework selection
- [ ] Testing framework selection
- [ ] Monitoring and observability tools

## Next Actions

1. Complete requirements analysis
2. Research Strava API capabilities
3. Investigate webhook implementation options
4. Begin implementation options analysis
5. Update decision log with findings

## Notes

- This is an experimental project comparing design-first vs. code-first approaches
- All decisions should be documented for future comparison
- Focus on practical, implementable solutions
- Maintain high quality standards throughout development
