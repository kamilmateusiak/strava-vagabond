# Finding: Problem Statement Requires Iterative Refinement

**Context:** During our chat session, we discovered multiple issues with our initial problem statement that required significant iteration. The user pointed out that "Route uniqueness detection > 95%" was impossible to measure without ground truth data. We also realized the document was too business-focused for a personal project, had repetitive text that was hard to read, and missed competitive analysis. The user specifically asked "How would we measure it? Would it be possible to know if the route uniqueness was detected correctly?" which led us to completely revise our success criteria approach.  
**Finding:** Problem statements require iterative refinement even in design-first approaches. Initial versions often have unrealistic metrics, unclear scope, and miss important context.  
**Impact:** 
- Shows iterative refinement is valuable in all methodologies
- Prevents unrealistic project expectations
- Improves project planning and scope definition

**Recommendations:** 
- Plan for multiple problem statement iterations
- Include competitive analysis early
- Challenge unrealistic metrics
- Document the evolution process

**Current Project Impact:** 
- Problem statement is now realistic and achievable
- Scope is clearly defined with proper phases
- Success criteria are measurable and realistic
