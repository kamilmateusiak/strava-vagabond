# Finding: Documentation Order - PRD Should Come Before TDD

**Date:** 2025-08-20 21:40 UTC  
**Category:** Process  
**Context:** After creating the initial project structure and starting with the Technical Design Document (TDD), we realized that we jumped directly into technical design without first establishing clear product requirements and business goals.  
**Finding:** The proper documentation sequence should be: Product Requirements Document (PRD) → Technical Design Document (TDD) → Implementation. We started with TDD, which meant we were designing solutions before fully understanding what we were building and why.  
**Impact:** 
- Future projects should follow the correct documentation hierarchy
- PRD provides the "what" and "why" before TDD addresses the "how"
- This finding will improve our project planning methodology
- Helps establish clear scope and success criteria before technical decisions

**Recommendations:** 
- Always start with a PRD that clearly defines business goals, user needs, and success criteria
- Include specific requirements like user capacity, performance targets, and business constraints
- Use PRD as the foundation for all technical decisions in TDD
- Ensure stakeholder alignment on requirements before proceeding to technical design

**Current Project Impact:** 
- We will continue with our current TDD approach as planned
- This finding doesn't change our current project scope or methodology
- We'll use this insight to improve our TDD by ensuring it addresses the requirements we've identified
- Future phases of this project will benefit from this learning
