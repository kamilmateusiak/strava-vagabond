# AI Agents Ignore Technical Design Documents

## Finding

**Date**: 2025-08-30 13:45 UTC  
**Category**: AI Assistant Behavior  
**Status**: Identified  

## Context

During the initial project setup, the AI assistant repeatedly ignored our comprehensive technical design documents and tried to implement solutions that didn't align with our established architecture and requirements. Despite having detailed technical design documents (11 sections, 100% complete), the AI kept suggesting approaches that contradicted our decisions.

## Problem Description

### **What Happened**
1. **Ignored Framework Decision**: AI tried to implement Express.js despite our decision for Fastify
2. **Bypassed Architecture**: Created placeholder code instead of following Week 1 Foundation requirements
3. **Overcomplicated Solutions**: Added unnecessary abstractions when simple implementations were specified
4. **Dependency Confusion**: Mixed up when to add dependencies vs. when to implement features

### **Why This Matters**
- **Wasted Time**: Had to repeatedly correct AI's deviations from design
- **Architectural Inconsistency**: Risk of building wrong foundation
- **Decision Disregard**: AI ignored carefully made technical decisions
- **Pattern Violation**: Broke established development approach

## Root Cause Analysis

### **AI Assistant Limitations**
- **Document Comprehension**: AI doesn't automatically prioritize technical design over convenience
- **Pattern Recognition**: Needs explicit instructions on how to use design documents
- **Decision Respect**: Doesn't inherently respect previous decisions without explicit guidance
- **Context Switching**: May lose track of design requirements when implementing

### **Human-AI Collaboration Gap**
- **Assumption Gap**: AI assumes it knows better than documented decisions
- **Implementation Bias**: Tends toward "working code" over "correct architecture"
- **Document Integration**: Doesn't naturally integrate design docs into implementation

## Solution: Explicit Pattern Enforcement

### **Critical Pattern for Every Task**
The AI agent must follow this exact sequence for every implementation task:

1. **Step 1: Check Technical Design Requirements**
   - Read relevant sections of technical design documents
   - Identify specific requirements for the current task
   - Understand architectural decisions and constraints
   - Note any dependencies or prerequisites

2. **Step 2: Implement Code Based on Design**
   - Write code that directly addresses design requirements
   - Follow established architectural patterns
   - Respect previous technical decisions
   - Implement exactly what the design specifies

3. **Step 3: Install Dependencies Used in Code**
   - Add only the packages the implemented code actually needs
   - Include TypeScript types and development dependencies
   - Follow dependency-driven development approach
   - Document why each dependency was added

4. **Step 4: Verify Implementation Compliance**
   - Check TypeScript compilation
   - Verify code follows design specifications
   - Ensure architectural consistency
   - Validate against requirements

### **Why This Pattern Works**
- **Design-First Approach**: Forces AI to read and understand design before coding
- **Dependency Discipline**: Prevents premature dependency installation
- **Verification Loop**: Ensures implementation matches requirements
- **Consistency**: Creates repeatable process for all tasks

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Design Compliance**: Code now follows technical design exactly
- **Architectural Consistency**: Foundation matches planned architecture
- **Efficient Development**: No time wasted on wrong implementations
- **Decision Respect**: AI now respects established technical decisions

### **Considerations**
- **Pattern Enforcement**: Must explicitly remind AI of this pattern for each task
- **Document Maintenance**: Technical design documents must stay current and accurate
- **Human Oversight**: Still need human review to ensure pattern is followed
- **Learning Curve**: AI may need multiple reminders before pattern becomes automatic

## Implementation Notes

- **Pattern Documentation**: This finding should be referenced in all future AI interactions
- **Task Instructions**: Always start with "Follow the pattern: Design → Implementation → Dependencies → Verification"
- **Document References**: Explicitly point AI to specific technical design sections
- **Verification**: Always verify that AI followed the pattern before proceeding

## Future Recommendations

1. **Pattern Reinforcement**: Remind AI of this pattern at the start of every major task
2. **Document Integration**: Explicitly reference technical design sections in task descriptions
3. **Verification Steps**: Always include verification step in task instructions
4. **Architecture Reviews**: Regular reviews to ensure AI implementations match design
