# Finding: Realistic Success Criteria Are Essential for Project Success

**Context:** During our chat, the user directly challenged our success criteria: "Route uniqueness detection > 95% - how would we measure it? Would it be possible to know if the route uniqueness was detected correctly?" This was a perfect example of how unrealistic metrics can slip into technical documents. We had included "99.9% uptime" and "10,000+ concurrent users" without thinking about how to measure or achieve them. The user's questioning led us to completely revise our approach, focusing on what we could actually measure and achieve for a personal project.  
**Finding:** Unrealistic success criteria set projects up for failure by creating impossible expectations. Realistic criteria should focus on what can actually be measured, achieved, and validated.  
**Impact:** 
- Prevents setting impossible expectations that lead to project failure
- Focuses effort on achievable, measurable outcomes
- Creates realistic project timelines and resource requirements
- Improves stakeholder satisfaction through achievable goals

**Recommendations:** 
- Always challenge success criteria for realism and measurability
- Separate measurable metrics from aspirational goals
- Focus on functional correctness over perfection metrics
- Consider project scope and resources when setting targets

**Current Project Impact:** 
- Success criteria are now achievable and measurable
- Project scope is realistic for personal development
- Focus is on core functionality over perfection
- Risk of project failure is significantly reduced
