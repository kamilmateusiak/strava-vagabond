# Finding: Research Before Documentation is Critical

**Date:** 2025-08-29 10:19 UTC  
**Category:** AI Assistant Behavior  
**Impact Level:** High  

## Context

During the Security & Privacy section development, the AI assistant (me) documented database encryption features based on assumptions rather than actual research. I documented `pgcrypto` extension usage and `pgp_sym_encrypt()` functions without verifying that Neon PostgreSQL actually supports these features.

## Finding

**AI assistants must research technology capabilities before documenting implementation details. Assumption-based documentation leads to implementation failures and wasted development effort.**

### **Specific Example from This Project**:

#### **What I Documented (Incorrectly)**:
```sql
-- I documented this without research
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;

UPDATE users SET 
  strava_access_token = pgp_sym_encrypt(strava_access_token, current_setting('app.encryption_key')),
  strava_refresh_token = pgp_sym_encrypt(strava_refresh_token, current_setting('app.encryption_key'))
WHERE id = $1;
```

#### **What I Should Have Done**:
- **Research Neon's actual capabilities** before writing encryption code
- **Verify extension support** before documenting implementation
- **Check official documentation** for available features
- **Test assumptions** before committing to technical approaches

#### **Reality Check**:
- **pgcrypto extension**: Not available on Neon by default
- **Custom encryption**: Not needed - Neon provides AES-256 by default
- **Key management**: Handled automatically by Neon infrastructure

## Impact

### **Negative Consequences Avoided**:
- **Implementation Failure**: Would have tried to implement non-existent features
- **Wasted Development Time**: Building encryption systems that weren't needed
- **Security Confusion**: Multiple encryption layers could have caused issues
- **Documentation Mismatch**: Technical docs wouldn't match actual capabilities

### **Positive Outcomes from Research**:
- **Simpler Architecture**: Leverage Neon's built-in security
- **Better Security**: Professional, maintained encryption infrastructure
- **Faster Development**: No custom encryption code to write
- **Accurate Documentation**: Reflects actual system capabilities

## Root Causes

### **1. Pattern Recognition Bias**
- **AI sees encryption requirement** and defaults to "standard" PostgreSQL approach
- **Assumes extensions are available** without checking provider limitations
- **Uses familiar patterns** instead of researching specific implementations

### **2. Documentation-First Approach**
- **Writes technical specs** before understanding technology constraints
- **Documents "best practices"** without verifying applicability
- **Assumes universal availability** of PostgreSQL features

### **3. Missing Research Framework**
- **No systematic approach** to technology research
- **Skips capability verification** for the sake of documentation speed
- **Relies on general knowledge** instead of specific research

## Recommendations

### **For AI Assistants**:
1. **Research First**: Always research technology capabilities before documenting
2. **Verify Assumptions**: Test all assumptions about feature availability
3. **Check Official Docs**: Use official documentation, not general knowledge
4. **Document Reality**: Only document what you can verify exists

### **For Users**:
1. **Request Research**: Ask AI to research before documenting
2. **Verify Claims**: Double-check technical recommendations
3. **Ask for Sources**: Request documentation sources and research
4. **Test Assumptions**: Validate technical approaches before implementation

### **For Project Teams**:
1. **Research Phase**: Include research phase in technical design
2. **Capability Verification**: Verify technology capabilities before design
3. **Documentation Review**: Review technical docs for accuracy
4. **Implementation Testing**: Test assumptions before full implementation

## Implementation in This Project

### **Immediate Actions**:
1. **Updated Security Document**: Removed incorrect encryption implementation
2. **Documented Reality**: Neon's built-in encryption capabilities
3. **Simplified Architecture**: Leverage built-in security features

### **Future Process**:
1. **Research Phase**: Always research before documenting
2. **Capability Verification**: Verify features before implementation
3. **Documentation Accuracy**: Only document verified capabilities
4. **Assumption Testing**: Test all technical assumptions

## Lessons Learned

### **Critical for Technical Work**:
- **Research before documentation** prevents implementation failures
- **Verify capabilities** before committing to technical approaches
- **Built-in features** are often better than custom implementations
- **Assumption-based design** leads to wasted effort and confusion

### **AI Assistant Improvement**:
- **Research frameworks** prevent assumption-based documentation
- **Capability verification** ensures technical accuracy
- **Documentation quality** depends on research depth
- **User trust** requires accurate technical information
