# Decision Log

This directory contains all the decisions made during the development of the Strava Vagabond project. Each decision is documented with context, alternatives considered, and rationale.

## Decision Log Format

Each decision is documented in a separate markdown file following this structure:

```markdown
# Decision: [Brief Description]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC  
**Status:** [Proposed | Under Review | Accepted | Rejected | Deprecated | Implemented]  
**Context:** [What led to this decision]  
**Decision:** [What was decided]  
**Consequences:** [What this means for the project]  
**Alternatives Considered:** [Other options that were evaluated]  
**Implementation Notes:** [How to implement this decision]  
**References:** [Links to relevant documentation, discussions, etc.]
```

## Decision Categories

- **Architecture**: System design, technology choices, patterns
- **API Design**: Endpoint design, data models, interfaces
- **Data Management**: Database design, storage strategies
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection
- **Monitoring**: Observability, metrics, alerting
- **Development Process**: Tools, workflows, testing strategies

## Status Definitions

### **Proposed** üÜï
- **What it means**: Initial idea or suggestion that needs evaluation
- **When to use**: First time a decision is documented
- **Next step**: Move to "Under Review" when ready to analyze

### **Under Review** üîç
- **What it means**: Decision is being analyzed and discussed
- **When to use**: When actively evaluating alternatives and gathering input
- **Next step**: Move to "Accepted", "Rejected", or back to "Proposed"

### **Accepted** ‚úÖ
- **What it means**: Decision has been approved and will be implemented
- **When to use**: When decision is finalized but not yet put into practice
- **Next step**: Move to "Implemented" when work is complete

### **Rejected** ‚ùå
- **What it means**: Decision has been evaluated and will not be implemented
- **When to use**: When decision is evaluated but alternative chosen instead
- **Next step**: Usually final status, but can be moved back to "Proposed" if circumstances change

### **Deprecated** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **What it means**: Previously accepted decision that is no longer valid
- **When to use**: When external factors make a decision obsolete
- **Next step**: Usually final status, indicates need for new decision

### **Implemented** üöÄ
- **What it means**: Decision has been put into practice
- **When to use**: When work is complete and decision is active
- **Next step**: Final status for successful decisions

## Decision Lifecycle

```
üÜï Proposed ‚Üí üîç Under Review ‚Üí ‚úÖ Accepted ‚Üí üöÄ Implemented
    ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚Üì
    ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚ùå Rejected
    ‚Üì              ‚Üì              ‚ö†Ô∏è Deprecated
    ‚Üì              ‚Üì
    ‚Üì              üîÑ (can return to Proposed)
    ‚Üì
    üîÑ (can return to Proposed)
```

**Key Points:**
- Decisions typically flow from left to right
- "Under Review" is the main evaluation phase
- "Accepted" decisions can still be rejected if new information emerges
- "Implemented" is usually the final state for successful decisions
- "Rejected" and "Deprecated" are terminal states but can be reconsidered

## How to Use This Log

1. **For Developers**: Review relevant decisions before implementing features
2. **For Stakeholders**: Understand the rationale behind technical choices
3. **For Future Reference**: Learn from past decisions and their outcomes
4. **For Presentations**: Use as source material for technical discussions

## Adding New Decisions

When making a new decision:
1. Create a new file with the next sequential number
2. Follow the standard format above
3. Update this README with the new decision
4. Link related decisions together
