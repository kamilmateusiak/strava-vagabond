# Decision: Decision Log Format

**Date:** 2025-08-20 21:40 UTC  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Context:** Need to establish a consistent way to document all decisions made during the project for future reference, presentations, and comparison with the previous code-first approach.  
**Decision:** Use a structured markdown format for decision logging with clear sections for context, decision, consequences, alternatives, and implementation notes.  
**Consequences:** 
- All decisions will be consistently documented
- Future team members can understand rationale behind choices
- Decisions can be easily referenced in presentations and articles
- Provides clear audit trail of project evolution
- Enables comparison between design-first and code-first approaches

**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Simple bullet points (rejected - insufficient detail)
- Formal technical documents (rejected - too heavy for rapid iteration)
- Database-driven decision tracking (rejected - overkill for this scope)
- Video recordings (rejected - not easily searchable or referenceable)

**Implementation Notes:** 
- Each decision gets a sequential number (001, 002, etc.)
- Standard format includes: Date, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences, Alternatives, Implementation Notes, References
- Status tracking: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated
- Categorization by decision type (Architecture, API Design, etc.)
- Cross-referencing between related decisions

**References:** 
- Project requirements for documentation and process tracking
- Need for presentation material for experiment comparison
