# Dependency-Driven Development Approach

## Decision

**Date**: 2025-08-30 13:19 UTC  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Type**: Development Process  

## Context

During the initial project setup, we needed to decide how to approach dependency management. The technical design document outlined many dependencies that would be needed throughout the project, but we needed to establish when and how to add them.

## Decision

**Dependency-Driven Development**: Dependencies will be added only when implementing features that actually require them, rather than installing everything upfront.

### Implementation Approach
1. **Start with minimal package.json**: Only basic project metadata and scripts
2. **Add dependencies incrementally**: Install packages only when implementing features that need them
3. **Document dependencies**: Keep track of why each dependency was added
4. **Version management**: Use specific versions to ensure consistency

### Benefits
- **Leaner development**: No unused packages cluttering the project
- **Learning by doing**: Better understanding of what each dependency actually provides
- **Faster initial setup**: Can start development immediately without waiting for all installs
- **Clearer purpose**: Each dependency has a clear reason for being in the project
- **Easier debugging**: Fewer potential conflicts during initial development

## Rationale

### Why Not Install Everything Upfront
- **Unused dependencies**: Many packages might not be needed for initial development
- **Version conflicts**: Installing everything at once can lead to compatibility issues
- **Learning curve**: Better to understand each dependency as you use it
- **Development speed**: Can start coding immediately rather than waiting for installs

### Why This Approach Works
- **Agile development**: Matches the iterative approach of our implementation plan
- **Feature-focused**: Dependencies align with actual features being built
- **Documentation**: Each dependency addition becomes part of the feature implementation
- **Testing**: Can test each dependency in isolation as features are built

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Cleaner project**: Only necessary dependencies
- **Better understanding**: Developers learn dependencies as they use them
- **Faster iteration**: Can start development immediately
- **Clearer architecture**: Dependencies map directly to features

### Considerations
- **Installation tracking**: Need to document when and why dependencies are added
- **Feature planning**: Dependencies must be planned as part of feature implementation
- **Team coordination**: All developers need to understand this approach

## Implementation Notes

- **Initial package.json**: Contains only project metadata and scripts
- **Dependency addition**: Will happen during feature implementation tasks
- **Documentation**: Each dependency addition should be documented in commit messages
- **Version control**: Dependencies will be added incrementally through the development process
