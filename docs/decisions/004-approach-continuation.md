# Decision: Continue Current TDD-First Approach

**Date:** 2025-08-20 21:40 UTC  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Context:** After documenting the finding that PRD should come before TDD, we needed to decide whether to pivot our approach or continue with the current TDD-first methodology. This decision balances process improvement learning with project momentum.  
**Decision:** Continue with the current TDD-first approach as planned, using the PRD insight to improve our TDD quality and document this as a valuable learning for future projects.  
**Consequences:** 
- Project maintains momentum and doesn't lose time to restructuring
- We can demonstrate iterative process improvement within the same project
- TDD will be enhanced by applying PRD principles where possible
- This becomes a perfect case study for comparing design-first vs. code-first approaches
- Future phases of the project will benefit from this learning

**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Pivot to create PRD first (rejected - would delay project and lose momentum)
- Abandon current approach entirely (rejected - defeats the purpose of the experiment)
- Create lightweight PRD alongside TDD (rejected - would create confusion and scope creep)
- Continue without acknowledging the finding (rejected - would miss valuable learning opportunity)

**Implementation Notes:** 
- Continue with current TDD structure and timeline
- Apply PRD principles to improve TDD quality where possible
- Document this decision and its rationale for future reference
- Use this as evidence of iterative improvement in design-first approach
- Plan to create proper PRD in future projects based on this learning
