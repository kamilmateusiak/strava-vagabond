# Decision: Improve Decision Status System

**Date:** 2025-08-20 21:45 UTC  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Context:** After receiving feedback that our initial decision status system was too limited and that we were using "Accepted" status inappropriately for decisions that were already implemented, we needed to improve the status tracking system to better reflect the actual state of decisions.  
**Decision:** Enhance the decision status system by adding new status options, providing clear definitions for each status, and updating existing decisions with more appropriate statuses that accurately reflect their current state.  
**Consequences:** 
- More granular tracking of decision lifecycle from proposal to implementation
- Better visibility into which decisions are still pending vs. already implemented
- Clearer communication about decision states for team members and stakeholders
- Improved project tracking and decision audit trail
- Better foundation for future decision management

**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Keep existing simple status system (rejected - insufficient granularity)
- Use only binary accepted/rejected statuses (rejected - doesn't show implementation state)
- Create complex workflow statuses (rejected - overkill for current project scope)
- Ignore the feedback and continue with current system (rejected - would miss opportunity for improvement)

**Implementation Notes:** 
- Added new status options: "Under Review", "Implemented"
- Created clear definitions for all status types
- Updated existing decisions with appropriate statuses:
  - Project setup decisions: "Implemented" (already done)
  - Current approach decision: "Accepted" (approved but not yet implemented)
- Updated decision log README with status definitions
- All timestamps corrected to actual current date
