# Decision: Project Structure and Organization

**Date:** 2025-08-20 21:40 UTC  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Context:** Need to establish a clear, maintainable project structure that supports the design-first development approach and provides clear separation of concerns.  
**Decision:** Implement a documentation-first project structure with clear directories for docs, source code, tests, and configuration, following industry best practices for technical projects.  
**Consequences:** 
- Clear organization makes the project easy to navigate and understand
- Documentation-first approach ensures technical decisions are captured before implementation
- Separated concerns make it easier for team members to work on different aspects
- Professional structure suitable for presentations and future collaboration
- Easy to maintain and extend as the project grows

**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Flat file structure (rejected - becomes unmanageable as project grows)
- Code-first with minimal docs (rejected - defeats the purpose of this experiment)
- Overly complex enterprise structure (rejected - too heavy for this scope)
- Monorepo with multiple services (rejected - premature optimization)

**Implementation Notes:** 
- `docs/` - All project documentation including TDD and decision logs
- `src/` - Source code (structure to be determined during design phase)
- `tests/` - Test files and test utilities
- `config/` - Configuration files and project settings
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts and automation tools
- Clear README files in each directory explaining purpose
- Consistent naming conventions throughout
- Git-friendly structure with appropriate .gitignore

**References:** 
- Industry best practices for technical project organization
- Need for clear documentation for experiment comparison
- Requirements for maintainable, scalable codebase
