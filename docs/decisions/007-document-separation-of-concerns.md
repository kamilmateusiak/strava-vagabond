# Decision: Implement Document Separation of Concerns

**Date:** 2025-08-20 23:20 UTC  
**Status:** Implemented  
**Context:** After completing both the Problem Statement and Requirements Analysis documents, we discovered significant redundancy and overlap between them. Both documents contained scope definitions, constraints, and success criteria, making them confusing to read and difficult to maintain. The user requested a clear separation to eliminate this redundancy and improve document clarity.  
**Decision:** Restructure the technical design documents to clearly separate business and technical concerns. Problem Statement focuses on business context, competitive analysis, and high-level success criteria. Requirements Analysis focuses on technical specifications, functional requirements, and detailed scope. This eliminates redundancy and creates a logical information flow.  
**Consequences:** 
- **Eliminated Redundancy**: No more duplicate information across documents
- **Clear Document Purpose**: Each document now serves a specific audience and purpose
- **Better Maintainability**: Single source of truth for each type of information
- **Improved Readability**: Business stakeholders and technical teams can focus on relevant documents
- **Logical Structure**: Clear progression from business context to technical implementation

**Alternatives Considered:** 
- Keep current structure with redundancy (rejected - confusing and hard to maintain)
- Merge documents into one large document (rejected - would be overwhelming and hard to navigate)
- Create separate business and technical documents (rejected - would fragment the TDD unnecessarily)
- Keep current structure but reduce overlap (rejected - partial solution that doesn't address root cause)

**Implementation Notes:** 
- Restructured Problem Statement to focus on business context and competitive analysis
- Moved scope definitions, constraints, and technical details to Requirements Analysis
- Added document focus notes and cross-references between documents
- Updated Technical Design README with clear document descriptions
- Created finding and decision documentation for future reference
