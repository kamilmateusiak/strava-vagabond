# Web Framework Selection: Fastify

## Decision

**Date**: 2025-08-30 13:32 UTC  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Type**: Technology Choice  

## Context

During the initial project setup, we needed to choose between Express.js and Fastify as our web framework. Both were mentioned in our technical design as options, but we needed to make a specific choice to proceed with implementation.

## Decision

**Select Fastify as our web framework** over Express.js.

### **Rationale for Fastify**
1. **Better TypeScript Support**: Native TypeScript support with better type inference
2. **Performance**: Significantly faster than Express.js (benchmarks show 2-3x improvement)
3. **Less Boilerplate**: Built-in validation, serialization, and error handling
4. **Modern Architecture**: Designed with modern Node.js patterns in mind
5. **Plugin System**: Better plugin architecture for middleware and features
6. **Validation**: Built-in JSON Schema validation with Ajv
7. **Serialization**: Automatic response serialization and optimization

### **Why Not Express.js**
1. **TypeScript Support**: Requires additional type packages and has weaker type inference
2. **Performance**: Slower than Fastify, especially for JSON APIs
3. **Boilerplate**: More custom code needed for validation, error handling, etc.
4. **Middleware Complexity**: More complex middleware patterns for modern features

## Consequences

### **Positive**
- **Better Developer Experience**: Superior TypeScript integration
- **Higher Performance**: Better performance for our API endpoints
- **Less Custom Code**: Built-in features reduce implementation time
- **Modern Patterns**: Better aligned with current Node.js best practices
- **Validation**: Built-in request/response validation

### **Considerations**
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Fastify patterns
- **Ecosystem**: Smaller ecosystem compared to Express.js
- **Documentation**: Less community resources and examples
- **Migration**: If we need to switch later, more work required

## Implementation Notes

- **Framework**: Fastify with TypeScript
- **Validation**: Use Fastify's built-in JSON Schema validation
- **Serialization**: Leverage Fastify's response serialization
- **Plugins**: Use Fastify's plugin system for middleware
- **Error Handling**: Use Fastify's error handling patterns
