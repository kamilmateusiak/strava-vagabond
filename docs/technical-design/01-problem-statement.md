# Problem Statement

## Executive Summary

I lack visibility into my cycling exploration patterns. I cannot easily determine how much of my rides cover new territory versus previously visited routes, making it difficult to track my exploration progress and plan future adventures.

## Problem Definition

**Core Issue**: No automated way to analyze route uniqueness across my cycling activities.

**Impact**: I cannot:
- Quantify how much new ground I'm covering
- Identify unexplored areas for future rides
- Measure my exploration progress over time
- Avoid unknowingly repeating routes

## Current State

### Existing Capabilities
- Strava tracks GPS coordinates and route data
- Basic activity recording and historical storage
- Manual route comparison possible but impractical

### Missing Functionality
- **Route Uniqueness Analysis**: Automated detection of new vs. previously ridden paths
- **Exploration Metrics**: Percentage calculation of new route coverage
- **Historical Route Database**: Persistent storage of unique route segments
- **Route Discovery Tools**: Interactive maps and recommendations for unexplored areas
- **Exploration Insights**: Data-driven suggestions for new riding experiences

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
- **[Wandrer.earth](https://wandrer.earth/)**: Most comprehensive solution
  - **Strengths**: Full-featured exploration tracking, gamification, multi-platform
  - **Weaknesses**: Premium pricing ($8.99/month), complex feature set
  - **Our Opportunity**: Focus on core uniqueness analysis at no cost

### Indirect Competitors
- **Strava Heatmaps**: Shows route frequency, not uniqueness
- **Komoot**: Route planning focused, limited analysis
- **RideWithGPS**: Basic recording, no uniqueness detection

### Market Gap
- **High-Cost Solutions**: Wandrer requires premium subscription
- **Feature Overload**: Many solutions include unnecessary complexity
- **Limited Focus**: No solution focuses solely on route uniqueness analysis

## User Impact

### Primary User: Me
- **Exploration Blindness**: No visibility into my territory coverage
- **Manual Work**: Must manually compare routes for overlap
- **Progress Uncertainty**: Cannot measure my exploration achievements
- **Route Repetition**: May unknowingly repeat paths

### Future Potential: Other Cyclists
- **Route Sharing**: Could help identify truly unique routes
- **Community Planning**: Potential for group ride optimization

## Personal Value

### For Me
- **Motivation**: Quantified progress encourages continued cycling
- **Discovery**: Interactive tools to find unexplored areas
- **Achievement**: Concrete metrics for personal goals
- **Planning**: Data-driven route selection and recommendations

### Discovery Capabilities
- **Visual Exploration**: Interactive maps showing ridden vs. unexplored areas
- **Gap Identification**: Specific streets and neighborhoods you haven't visited
- **Route Suggestions**: Data-driven recommendations for new experiences
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress toward area completion goals

### Future Potential
- **Personal Platform**: Could become a portfolio project
- **Learning Experience**: Valuable technical and business insights
- **Community Contribution**: Potential to help other cyclists
- **Market Opportunity**: Addresses gap left by expensive/complex solutions
- **Differentiation**: Focused solely on route uniqueness analysis

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- **Performance**: Analysis completion < 5 minutes post-ride
- **Reliability**: Stable analysis services for personal use
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface for personal route analysis
- **Data Quality**: Consistent GPS coordinate processing and storage

### Personal Metrics
- **Satisfaction**: Positive experience with exploration insights
- **Engagement**: Regular use for post-ride analysis
- **Discovery**: Finding new routes I wouldn't have considered
- **Learning**: Valuable insights into my cycling patterns

### Measurement Challenges
- **Route Uniqueness Accuracy**: Difficult to measure without ground truth data
- **Route Matching Algorithm**: How to determine if two GPS tracks represent the same route
- **Coordinate Comparison**: Defining what constitutes "same" vs "different" paths
- **Personal Validation**: Ultimately, I'll know if the results feel right

## Constraints

### Technical
- Must integrate with existing Strava API
- No impact on Strava performance
- Process GPS data from Strava consistently
- Support multiple cycling disciplines

### Business
- Respect Strava terms of service
- No platform modifications required
- Personal project with potential for expansion
- Value without premium subscriptions

### Privacy
- Protect user location data
- GDPR compliance
- User control over data sharing
- Minimal data retention

## Scope

### In Scope (Phase 1)
- Personal activity analysis
- Route uniqueness detection
- Historical route database
- REST API for results
- Basic authentication and Strava integration

### Phase 2: Discovery Features
- Interactive exploration map
- Unexplored area identification
- Route gap analysis
- Basic route recommendations

### Future Phases
- Advanced route suggestions
- Exploration challenges and goals
- Social features (if expanding to community)
- Mobile applications
- Multi-platform integration

## Next Steps

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Technical Research**: Strava API capabilities investigation
3. **Solution Design**: Architecture and implementation planning
4. **Feasibility Assessment**: Technical and business viability

## Why This Analysis Matters

### For Technical Design
- **Proven Concept**: Competitors validate the market need
- **Feature Scope**: Helps define what's essential vs. nice-to-have
- **Technical Requirements**: Understanding integration patterns
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Setting realistic targets

### Discovery Feature Design
- **Map Integration**: Interactive visualization of riding patterns
- **Gap Analysis**: Algorithm to identify unexplored areas
- **Recommendation Engine**: Suggest routes based on unexplored gaps
- **Progress Visualization**: Show completion percentages by area/neighborhood

### For Personal Project
- **Learning Value**: Study how others solved similar problems
- **Avoiding Pitfalls**: Learn from competitor limitations
- **Focus Definition**: Stay focused on core uniqueness analysis
- **Future Expansion**: Understand what could be added later

## Realistic Success Criteria

### What We Can Actually Measure
- **Performance**: Analysis completion time (measurable)
- **Reliability**: System uptime and error rates (measurable)
- **Usability**: Time to complete analysis tasks (measurable)
- **Data Consistency**: GPS coordinate processing reliability (measurable)

### GPS Data Considerations
- **Data Source**: Strava provides processed GPS coordinates
- **Our Responsibility**: Process and compare coordinates consistently
- **Not Our Concern**: Raw GPS accuracy or device precision
- **Key Challenge**: Algorithm for determining route similarity

### What We Cannot Easily Measure
- **Route Uniqueness Accuracy**: Requires ground truth data we don't have
- **Algorithm Perfection**: Subjective assessment of route matching quality
- **User Satisfaction**: Personal experience, not quantifiable metrics

### Focus Areas for Phase 1
- **Functional Correctness**: Does the system work as intended?
- **Performance**: Is it fast enough for personal use?
- **Reliability**: Does it handle errors gracefully?
- **Usability**: Is it easy to use for post-ride analysis?
