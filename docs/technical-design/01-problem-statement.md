# Problem Statement

## Problem Definition

Cyclists using Strava lack visibility into their exploration patterns and cannot easily determine how much of their rides cover new territory versus previously visited routes. This makes it difficult to:

1. **Track Exploration Progress**: Understand how much new ground they're covering
2. **Plan Future Rides**: Identify areas they haven't explored yet
3. **Measure Adventure Quotient**: Quantify the novelty of each cycling adventure
4. **Historical Analysis**: Review their exploration journey over time

## Current State

### What Exists Today
- Strava provides basic activity tracking and route recording
- GPS data is captured but not analyzed for uniqueness
- No built-in way to identify overlapping or new route segments
- Historical route analysis requires manual comparison

### What's Missing
- **Route Uniqueness Analysis**: No automated way to determine if a route segment has been ridden before
- **Exploration Metrics**: No percentage calculation of new vs. previously ridden paths
- **Historical Route Database**: No persistent storage of unique route segments
- **Automated Insights**: No post-ride analysis or summaries

## User Pain Points

### Primary Users: Cyclists
1. **Lack of Exploration Awareness**: Can't easily see how much new territory they're covering
2. **Manual Route Comparison**: Must manually check if routes overlap with previous rides
3. **No Progress Tracking**: Can't measure their exploration progress over time
4. **Missed Opportunities**: May unknowingly repeat routes when seeking new experiences

### Secondary Users: Cycling Communities
1. **Route Sharing**: Can't easily identify truly unique routes to share with others
2. **Group Planning**: Difficulty in planning group rides that maximize new experiences for all participants

## Business Value

### For Individual Cyclists
- **Motivation**: Quantified exploration progress encourages continued cycling
- **Discovery**: Better understanding of unexplored areas in their region
- **Achievement**: Concrete metrics for personal cycling goals
- **Planning**: Data-driven route planning for future rides

### For the Platform
- **User Engagement**: Increased motivation leads to more frequent Strava usage
- **Data Insights**: Valuable analytics on cycling patterns and preferences
- **Community Building**: Enhanced route sharing and discovery features
- **Competitive Advantage**: Unique feature not available in other cycling apps

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics
1. **Accuracy**: Route uniqueness detection accuracy > 95%
2. **Performance**: Activity analysis completed within 5 minutes of ride completion
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for analysis services
4. **Scalability**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent users

### Qualitative Metrics
1. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on exploration insights
2. **Engagement**: Increased frequency of post-ride analysis
3. **Discovery**: Users report finding new routes they wouldn't have considered
4. **Community**: Enhanced route sharing and discussion

## Constraints and Limitations

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing Strava API
- Should not impact Strava's performance
- Must handle GPS coordinate precision and accuracy variations
- Should work with various activity types (road, mountain, gravel, etc.)

### Business Constraints
- Must respect Strava's terms of service
- Should not require changes to Strava's platform
- Must be financially sustainable as a standalone service
- Should provide value without requiring premium Strava subscriptions

### Privacy Constraints
- Must protect user location data
- Should comply with GDPR and other privacy regulations
- Must provide user control over data sharing
- Should minimize data retention requirements

## Problem Scope

### In Scope
- Analysis of individual cycling activities
- Route uniqueness detection and calculation
- Historical route database management
- API for accessing analysis results
- Basic user authentication and Strava integration

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Real-time route recommendations
- Social features and route sharing
- Mobile applications
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with other fitness platforms

## Next Steps

With the problem clearly defined, the next phase involves:
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Detailed functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Technical Research**: Investigation of Strava API capabilities and limitations
3. **Solution Design**: Architecture and implementation approach planning
4. **Feasibility Assessment**: Technical and business viability evaluation
