# Problem Statement

## Executive Summary

I lack visibility into my cycling exploration patterns. I cannot easily determine how much of my rides cover new territory versus previously visited routes, making it difficult to track my exploration progress and plan future adventures.

## Problem Definition

**Core Issue**: No automated way to analyze route uniqueness across my cycling activities.

**Impact**: I cannot quantify how much new ground I'm covering, identify unexplored areas for future rides, measure my exploration progress over time, or avoid unknowingly repeating routes.

## Current State

Strava tracks GPS coordinates and route data, providing basic activity recording and historical storage. However, there's no built-in way to identify overlapping or new route segments, and historical route analysis requires manual comparison.

**Missing Functionality**: The platform lacks automated route uniqueness analysis, exploration metrics calculation, historical route database management, and route discovery tools that could provide data-driven suggestions for new riding experiences.

## Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors**: [Wandrer.earth](https://wandrer.earth/) offers the most comprehensive solution with full-featured exploration tracking, gamification, and multi-platform integration. However, it requires a premium subscription ($8.99/month) and includes complex features that may be unnecessary for focused route uniqueness analysis.

**Indirect Competitors**: Strava Heatmaps show route frequency but not uniqueness, Komoot focuses on route planning with limited analysis, and RideWithGPS provides basic recording without uniqueness detection.

**Market Gap**: Existing solutions are either high-cost or feature-overloaded, with no solution focusing solely on route uniqueness analysis. This creates an opportunity for a focused, cost-effective alternative.

## User Impact

**Primary User - Me**: I currently experience exploration blindness with no visibility into territory coverage, must manually compare routes for overlap, cannot measure exploration achievements, and may unknowingly repeat paths.

**Future Potential - Other Cyclists**: The solution could help identify truly unique routes for sharing and optimize group ride planning to maximize new experiences for all participants.

## Personal Value

**For Me**: The solution provides motivation through quantified progress, discovery of unexplored areas, achievement tracking with concrete metrics, and data-driven route selection and recommendations.

**Discovery Capabilities**: The system will offer visual exploration through interactive maps showing ridden vs. unexplored areas, gap identification for specific streets and neighborhoods, route suggestions based on unexplored areas, and progress tracking toward area completion goals.

**Future Potential**: This could become a portfolio project, provide valuable technical and business insights, contribute to the cycling community, address market gaps left by expensive solutions, and differentiate through focused uniqueness analysis.

## Success Criteria

**Actually Measurable**: Analysis completion time (target: < 5 minutes), system uptime percentage, API response times, and error rate frequency.

**Personal Aspirations**: Positive user experience, regular usage patterns, discovery of new routes, and valuable insights into cycling patterns.

**Implementation Goals**: Functional system that works as intended, performance suitable for personal use, error handling that doesn't crash the system, and interface that's easy to navigate.

**GPS Data Approach**: Strava provides processed coordinates from completed workouts. We analyze historical data for uniqueness without concerning ourselves with raw GPS accuracy, device precision, or real-time processing. The key challenge is developing algorithms for determining route similarity from completed workout data.

## Constraints

**Technical**: The system must integrate with existing Strava API without impacting performance, handle API rate limits and errors gracefully, and support multiple cycling disciplines.

**Strava API Specific**: We must respect API rate limits (requests per hour/day), handle rate limit errors gracefully with retry logic, process completed workouts rather than real-time data, and work within API data availability and format constraints.

**Business**: The project must respect Strava terms of service, require no platform modifications, function as a personal project with expansion potential, and provide value without premium subscriptions.

**Privacy**: User location data must be protected, GDPR compliance maintained, user control over data sharing provided, and data retention minimized.

## Scope

**Phase 1 - Core Analysis**: Personal activity analysis, route uniqueness detection, historical route database, REST API for results, and basic authentication with Strava integration.

**Phase 2 - Discovery Features**: Interactive exploration map, unexplored area identification, route gap analysis, and basic route recommendations.

**Future Phases**: Advanced route suggestions, exploration challenges and goals, social features (if expanding to community), mobile applications, and multi-platform integration.

## Out of Scope

**Real-time Features**: Live GPS tracking, real-time route analysis, or instant notifications during rides.

**Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning route recommendations, predictive analysis, or complex statistical modeling.

**Social Features**: User communities, route sharing platforms, leaderboards, or social media integration.

**Mobile Applications**: Native iOS/Android apps, mobile-specific features, or offline functionality.

**Multi-platform Integration**: Support for platforms beyond Strava (Garmin, Wahoo, etc.) in initial phases.

**Enterprise Features**: Multi-user management, advanced security, or business analytics.

**Data Export**: Complex data export formats, third-party integrations, or data migration tools.

## Next Steps

1. **Requirements Analysis**: Functional and non-functional requirements
2. **Technical Research**: Strava API capabilities investigation  
3. **Solution Design**: Architecture and implementation planning
4. **Feasibility Assessment**: Technical and business viability
