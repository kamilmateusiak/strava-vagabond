## Review Process

This document will be reviewed and updated throughout the development process. Each section should be completed before moving to implementation to ensure a solid technical foundation.

## Decision Tracking

All major technical decisions made during the design process are documented in the [Decision Log](../decisions/README.md) for future reference and comparison.
